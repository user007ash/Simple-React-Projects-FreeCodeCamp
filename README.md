# 🚀 React Projects for Beginners

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly React projects that I built while learning React. These projects are based on the ideas from [this freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-projects-for-beginners-easy-ideas-with-code/) and helped me grasp essential React concepts like components, state, props, and hooks.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Image Carousel
A simple React-based image slider that allows users to navigate through a set of images using next and previous buttons. Great for learning about state management and event handling.

### 2️⃣ FAQ/Accordion
An interactive FAQ section with collapsible answers. This project helps in understanding state toggling and conditional rendering in React.

### 3️⃣ Quote Generator
A random quote generator that fetches and displays motivational quotes with the click of a button. Covers fetching data from APIs and updating the UI dynamically.

### 4️⃣ Shopping List
A simple shopping list app where users can add, remove, and mark items as purchased. Demonstrates CRUD operations and local state management.

### 5️⃣ GitHub User Search
A search tool that fetches user data from GitHub’s API and displays relevant details like profile picture, repositories, and followers. Useful for understanding API integration and handling asynchronous operations in React.

### 6️⃣ Video Player
A basic video player with play, pause, and volume controls. This project covers media element handling and React event listeners.

### 7️⃣ BMI Calculator
A Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that allows users to input their weight and height and receive a calculated BMI. Helps in learning controlled components and form handling in React.
